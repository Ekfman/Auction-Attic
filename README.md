# The Auction Attic
### A super simple version of Craigslist. This is a front-end project built with JSX, HTML, and CSS. The front-end connects to a pre-existing back-end that allows users to create an account, which gives them the ability to add, update, and delete item listings, as well as send and receive inquiries.
 
*This was my first front-end React project.*
